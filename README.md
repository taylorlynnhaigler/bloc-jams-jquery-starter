Summary
My client was seeking to create a new cloud storage platform that would stand out from competitors in the marketplace. Since the market is saturated, the client and stakeholders were looking to to cater to a user base who may not be finding what they need from well-used platforms. She specifically needed help developing a vision for the project and crafting a brand identity for the concept. My role in the project was to to create a new brand and prototype design. I walked the client through the UX cycle and let the design evolve based on the user feedback I received.

Problem
The biggest barrier was that the client did not have a clear vision of the purpose of their app or their target audience. Through questioning the client and stakeholders, I learned that they were seeking to create an application that would entice users away from their go-to platform.
I asked the client what it was specifically they were envisionsing. They shared that they wanted a platform that would provide the user the ability to intuitively save, create, share, and manage content and collaborate across platforms. They wanted users to be able to transfer content easily to leverage a ‘network effect’ to attract more users to the platform to make it a financially viable endeavor.
Beyond these particular points, the project was a blank canvas. I was called on to conduct user research and testing to determine a target audience and create a brand identity and an application that would appeal to this audience.

Solution
Through user research and competitive analysis I discovered that in today’s world young professionals and students wear many different hats in their daily life. They may be enrolled in school, working and running a podcast as well.  These individuals could use a cloud storage platform that allows for multiple, customizable profiles that they can easily switch back and forth between. If the platform were to come equipped with specialized features, such as an integrated way to translate documents directly in the app, then these individuals may be enticed to try a cloud storage app that provides a deep level of customization and unique features.

I created Atlas, a storage platform designed to support the user’s world with a specific focus on individuals who need a platform for multiple areas in their life. The platform would create a space for these individuals to collaborate and strengthen their relationships with their peers, friends, teachers, colleagues all across the world to create and grow a diverse Atlas network.

Process  
User Research

I started by conducting research to get more familiar with the competition as well as potential users and their needs to shape the product’s focus and design.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Competitive Analysis

I reviewed what sets the main competitors apart. Who is their target audience? What is their positioning? Why is it that Google Drive and Box are certain user’s go-to’s? A competitive analysis helped to draw out the reasons why these platforms are successful and where there may be room for improvement.
For Box, it was robust security features and added capabilities geared towards web developers. To a regular user these features could be overwhelming and it was clear that it is both a strength and a weakness that it is as specialized for enterprise. This indicated users may turn to a new app that provides a more intuitive experience, particularly on the mobile end since Box’s mobile application is frequently criticized for poor usability.
Google drive’s performance metrics speak to the fact that they’ve been a leader in the marketplace for sometime. They have a diverse audience who enjoy using Drive seamlessly with other google applications, like gmail and google photos. For many it would be second nature to use if they’ve been part of the google ecosystem. Their strength is in their versatility and customization options. However, they are still a platform geared for a wide audience so one way to stand out from Google would be to have a niche or specialization that users might gravitate towards.
Pinterest, is an example of a niche platform since it it is visually focused and allows users to ‘pin’ an image to hold on to like a virtual corkboard. Individuals or businesses in particular industries, like retail, style, home, food and auto, use pinterest to visually showcase their work. There would be many ways to make adjustments to the platform to be more inviting to a male user base and other industries, but they set themselves apart by narrowing in on a particular functionalities and industries to cater to and excel in these areas.

User Survey
Next I conducted a user survey to identify which storage apps are most popular, why they like that platform over others and what the main reasons are that they need cloud storage capabilities.

In analyzing the survey results of 33 individuals, it became clear that if a new platform can deliver secure and ample storage space, superior file organization, allow for seamless collaboration, and keep subscription expenses low, it may be a contender to the larger platforms.

<<<<<<< HEAD




Another major touchpoint revealed that 51.6% of users are using storage platforms for both personal and business use, indicating it would be important to make it easy for users to switch back and forth between accounts.

The survey results did reveal particular stress points in the marketplace that would allow a competitor to step in as an opponent to the leading platforms.


In particular, some users mentioned they would be interested in a more intuitive UX experience, more storage space, and multi-user accounts.

A model that integrates these points could have great appeal to the target demographic that appears in the survey results, young professionals and students, and could have a chance of competing with these larger, well established platforms. Particularly if the app focuses on these features or functionalities that the other storage giants do not.

User Personas

Out the survey analysis, I created two user personas, Kris Mao and Jamie Love, to give voice to the individuals who participated in the surveys.

User Personas


Jamie, a student in her late 20s uses Dropbox for school to share content and collaborate with her teachers and classmates. She found Dropbox to be fairly expensive for a student and  she wishes she could upload large content files to her account easily. Overall she is looking for an option better geared towards students and those who use both their phone and desktop regularly to access their content.

Kris, an ESL teacher and popular blogger, is interested in a platform that handles switching between different profiles so he can quickly tackle tasks at hand for either of his roles. One big thing he feels is missing from most storage applications is translation options. If this were able to be incorporated into the design he could save a lot of time by doing it directly instead of using a third party application each time.

Their frustrations and goals helped shape the direction and organization of the platform to try to satisfy their desires that were not currently being met by their storage platforms. This helped define Atlas’ target audience -- those who need a storage platform for more than one purpose to create a hub for the whole scope of their content needs, in the classroom, boardroom, at home, etc.

Information Architecture
<<<<<<< HEAD
User stories & Flows
After developing a better understanding of who my users are, I developed user stories based off to identify which features and actions should be the main focus while creating a MVP for the client. Next I combined the user stories and user flow planning to drafting a sitemap to create the structure of the application to visually map out how a user may journey through the application to complete tasks.

Wireframes

Additionally I crafted a content strategy and sketched out wireframes to illustrate the basic layout of the app. It turned these sketches into digital wireframes to develop a static design to share with the client and users to see if things were moving in the right track.

<<<<<<< HEAD



User Testing

Usability testing of these wireframes revealed the strengths and weaknesses. I adjusted the design to improve usability based on the feedback I recieved. Mostly that it was difficult to dtermine how to sign up versus sign in, how one would add keywords and metadata to content. Another user had difficulty recognizing the icons and their function, which suggested it could be better to label icons for those who are less familiar with mobile applications in general.

I redesigned the user flow of the login process, adding and organizing content and how to share files. Additionally, I labeled icons I felt may be unclear and standardized some of the features to match iOS design, such as the sign in form, to decrease confusion and ensure tasks would be intuitive to new users.

Branding
After this initial user testing and deciding on the information architecture, I felt I had a clear idea of what users were seeking. At this point, I started the branding process.

Starting with a moodboard of visual images, I pulled imagery that were in line with  the vision and started determining the qualities that represent the brand Atlas. The words that came to the forefront were vibrant, curious, creative and expressive. I sourced imagery that spoke to these qualities to use throughout the design.


I decided to call this app ‘Atlas’ to hark back to the myth of atlas supporting the world on his back. The intention would be for platform to support the user’s world in all of their endeavors.

Next I designed the logo. I wanted it to be modern and expressive. Initially, for the logo I chose a lightning bolt to symbolize being ‘struck’ by a good idea.


Next I selected a color palette and typefaces that would represent these qualities and complement the imagery and logo. I created a brand style guide to showcase these choices and demonstrate how they come together to form a cohesive brand.

Style Guide version1

As I progressed, I revisited particular elements of the branding and changed the design and feel of the logo based on feedback from the client. I toned down the visual impact of the logo with a softer look for the text, and a more subtle icon of a globe.

Style Guide version 2


Once the branding was finalized, I returned to the wireframes and worked on developing a prototype.

Prototypes

I went through a great deal of iteration on my low-fi and high-fi prototypes.One can see the progression when looking at the three different prototype versions I created.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Prototype Version 1


Feedback suggested that the dark purple background was oversaturated with color and difficult to read. With the second iteration I changed to a white background to improve readability.

Prototype version 2


Preference and usability testing after round two revealed that I should work to simplify the layout of each screen down to the essentials and improve the user flow so that the action steps one might take were very clear.

After my mock-ups had been revised, I created a high fidelity prototype to enable the user to test out the flow of the mockups. This prototype is the result of synthesizing the research, testing and many rounds of iterations during this design cycle.




Conclusion
The project evolved based on what was revealed through each phase of the UX cycle. This led to an organic development of a concept, brand and prototype design. Since the client did not have a clear vision, there was a lot of freedom and room for opportunity with how the design would be shaped.
In the beginning it wasn’t obvious how a new storage platform could compete with such strong competitors. Trusting in the cycle and returning to the problems at hand to thinking of how to address them, allowed me to focus in on MVP to create the prototype.
I had doubts over whether I was straying from what the client and stakeholders had in mind, since they did not provide much in the way of expectations, but through checking in regularly and allowing to let the users to guide the development cycle, I believe I was able to deliver a design that satisfied both stakeholder and user concerns and desires.
Usability testing revealed that my initial designs were not straightforward or easy for the user to flow through. It’s important to consider how the design will be received by others and continually test out the design. I felt confident in certain aspects of the design, particularly the lighting bolt logo and the dark purple background, but I had to release what felt right to me if it was not received well by the users, and change these elements to cater to deliver the best possible design to my client.
With more time I would have tested users more frequently while iterating through design choices so that I did not move forward in a particular way before realizing I was straying from the solutions I was trying to solve and developing functionalities and flow patterns that will need to be revised.
I learned how important it is to conduct a wide range of research and focus in and the problems. Then to get very clear on what the solutions may be and create a specific MVP to be clear how the design will develop around essential action sequences.
In hindsight, I would have narrowed in to further develop a niche platform and features that would stand out from competitors even more.
I also learned the importance of creating an extensive design system to allow me as the designer to make changes and adjustments across the entire platform in a simple, quick, and straightforward way. This design system would be something I could share with the client so they have a framework, beyond the branding style guide, for building off the brand and design outside of the scope of this project.
In the future I will ensure that I incorporate more user testing in more frequent intervals and develop an all inclusive design system to provide more direction and structure.

Ultimately, the high fidelity prototype is just a starting point. Moving forward I would like to expand Atlas to incorporate more features and functionalities that would distinguish itself from other big-name platforms and continue to provide value to the target users as well as the stakeholders.
